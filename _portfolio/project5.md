**Challenges and Market Benefits**
The main challenge in CDN optimization for Netflix lies in managing the global scale of users and content distribution while maintaining high-quality streaming experiences across diverse network conditions. Addressing these challenges can lead to significant market benefits. Faster content delivery and reduced buffering improves user satisfaction and engagement. Also, optimizing CDN routes and caching strategies can reduce bandwidth costs and operational expenses.

**Design Technique:**

**_1.Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:_**
Ford-Fulkerson is used to find the maximum flow in a network by iteratively increasing flow along augmenting paths.Ford-Fulkerson optimizes traffic routing by adjusting flow rates between CDN nodes and edge servers in response to changing network dynamics.



**Complexity Analysis and Codes**
-_**Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:**_

Time Complexity: O(E * V^2) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices
Space Complexity: O(V^2) where V is the number of vertices
