title: Project Name
subtitle: Netflix categorizes and tags its extensive content library to improve searchability and provide a better user experience. Content categorization involves assigning genres, themes and tags to movies and TV shows, helping users easily find content that matches their preferences. Effective categorization and tagging also enable Netflix to recommend similar content based on viewing history and preferences, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.

**Challenges and Market Benefits**
The primary challenge is the huge content that needs to be accurately categorized and tagged, which requires sophisticated algorithms to automate the process. Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of tags is also important, as incorrect or irrelevant tags can negatively impact user experience and trust. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of content, as new titles are frequently added to the library.
Accurate categorization and tagging improve content discoverability, leading to increased user engagement and retention. It also helps in making recommendation system better and efficient, providing personalized suggestions that align with user preferences.

**Design Technique**
1.Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
Why it Works?
The LCS algorithm can be applied to content categorization by comparing the descriptions, titles and keywords of different shows and movies. By finding the longest common subsequences in the textual data,similarities between different pieces of content can be identified. This helps in grouping content into categories and assigning relevant tags.

Shortcomings and Scalability Issues:
The primary limitation of the LCS algorithm is its computational complexity. For two sequences of length ùëö and ùëõ the LCS algorithm has a **time complexity of 
O(m√ón)**, which can become impractical for very large datasets. Additionally, LCS is mainly suitable for textual data and might not capture the full semantic meaning or contextual relationships between content. Scalability is a challenge, as the algorithm needs to be optimized or parallelized to handle the vast content library.

2. Segment Trees
Why It Works:
Segment Trees are efficient for range queries and updates, which can be useful in categorizing and tagging content based on various attributes such as user ratings, watch times, and metadata changes. They provide **O(logn) time complexity** for both querying and updating, making them suitable for handling dynamic data efficiently.

Shortcomings and Scalability Issues:
The main limitation of Segment Trees is their space complexity, which is O(n). For a large number of content items, the memory overhead can become significant. Additionally, maintaining Segment Trees in a distributed system can be challenging due to the need for synchronization across different nodes.

Codes:
Here is my code for :
1. [Longest Common Subsequence](https://github.com/PAI-SHREYA/DSA/blob/main/Dynamic%20Programming/01_LargestCommonSubsequence.cpp)
   Time Complexity:  O(n * m)
   Space Complexity: O(m)
   where n=length of first string and m=length of second string.
