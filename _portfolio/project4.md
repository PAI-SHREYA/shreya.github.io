title: Fraud Detection in User Accounts
subtitle: Detecting fraudulent activity in user accounts is vital for maintaining the integrity and trust of the Netflix platform. Fraudulent activities can include account takeovers, fraudulent subscriptions, and abuse of free trials. Ensuring robust fraud detection mechanisms helps protect legitimate users and preserves the platform's reputation.

**Challenges and Market Benefits**
Distinguishing between legitimate user behavior and fraudulent activities amidst a massive data is difficult. Additionally, real-time detection is crucial for preventing ongoing fraud. Effective fraud detection not only protects user accounts but also ensures trust in the platform. Through thid,Netflix can also save on potential financial losses and maintain a secure user base.

**Design Technique**
**_1.Kruskal's Algorithm:_**
This is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. In the context of fraud detection, Kruskalâ€™s algorithm can help identify clusters of suspicious activities by finding the minimum connections (or interactions) that form these clusters.Union-Find data structure is used to manage and merge sets of connected nodes, which in this case represent user accounts and their interactions.

User interactions (e.g., account logins, subscription changes) can be represented as a graph where nodes are user accounts and edges represent interactions.We can group these interactions to identify connected components. Each connected component could represent a cluster of potentially suspicious activities.
Consider a scenario where multiple accounts are interacting in an unusual pattern, such as logging in from the same IP address or making similar subscription changes within a short period.

**_2.Subset Problem:_**
Use the subset sum problem to identify unusual spending patterns or access behaviors that deviate significantly from the norm.

**_3.Red-Black Tree:_**

**Complexity Analysis and code**
- _**Kruskal's Algorithm**_:
  
  Construction: O(n log n) 
  
  Update (Point Update): O(log n) 
  
  Query (Prefix Sum): O(log n)
  
  Space Complexity: O(n)
