**Challenges and Market Benefits:**

**Design Technique:**
**_1.Kadane's Algorithm_**:Kadane's Algorithm is used to find the maximum sum subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. In this case, this can be used to find the period of maximum user engagement by analyzing time-series data of user interactions, such as views or likes.Let's consider a scenario where we want to analyze user activity to identify binge-watching patterns and detect the longest streaks of continuous viewing activity by each user.
In the below graph,Kadane's algorithm is implemented to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a user's viewing activity data. It iterates through the array, maintaining two variables: max_ending_here (current subarray sum) and max_so_far (maximum sum found so far). By updating these variables dynamically, Kadane's algorithm identifies the longest streak of continuous viewing activity.

However,Kadane's Algorithm is limited to finding the maximum sum in a one-dimensional array and does not directly support complex queries or dynamic updates. It is best suited for scenarios where the primary goal is to identify peak engagement periods in a straightforward manner. 

**_2.DFS and BFS:_**
DFS and BFS can be used to analyze user interactions to detect patterns, preferences, and potential issues by traversing user interaction graphs.DFS can be used to explore user interaction sequences , identifying binge-watching patterns. DFS can reveal if a user consistently watches multiple episodes of a series in one sitting, highlighting binge-watching behavior.BFS can be used to analyze user behavior at each level, tracking how users discover new content and interact with the platform.
