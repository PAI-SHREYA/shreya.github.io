With the increasing amount of content and diverse user preferences, efficient and accurate algorithms are crucial for maintaining user engagement. One of the fundamental challenges in recommendation systems is to identify common patterns in user behaviors and content characteristics. The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm can play a significant role in this domain by identifying the longest sequence that is common in different user interaction histories, thus allowing Netflix to better understand user preferences and improve recommendations.
