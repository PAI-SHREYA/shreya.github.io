**Challenges and Market Benefits**

Challenges in this domain include dealing with the vast amount of data, maintaining up-to-date models as user behavior evolves, and ensuring data privacy and security. Additionally, accurately modeling the complex reasons behind user churn requires sophisticated algorithms that can handle the diverse and dynamic nature of user interactions. The market benefits of effective churn prediction are significant: it helps reduce customer acquisition costs by retaining existing users, increases lifetime value through targeted retention strategies, and enhances user satisfaction by addressing potential issues before they lead to churn. This ultimately strengthens Netflix's competitive position and revenue stability in the streaming industry.

**Design Technique**

**_1.Random Walk_**

Random walk model can be applied in churn prediction by capturing the structural properties and interaction patterns within a user network. 
By simulating random paths through the network, random walks help generate node embeddings that encode both local and global connectivity information. 
These embeddings can reflect user influence, centrality and community membership, which are important for understanding user behavior and predicting churn. 
Machine learning models can then use these embeddings as features to identify users at risk of churning, as they provide a nuanced representation of the user's position and relationships within the network.

Time Complexity: 

Performing a single random walk of length ùêø involves visiting L nodes, each requiring constant time O(1) to select the next node from its neighbors (assuming an adjacency list representation).Therefore, the time complexity O(L).

If K random walks are performed, each of length L, the overall time complexity would be O(K‚ãÖL). 

Space Complexity:

Storing the graph itself requires O(N+E) space, where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

Storing the paths generated by random walks requires additional space proportional to O(K‚ãÖL). This includes storing the sequence of nodes visited in each walk.
