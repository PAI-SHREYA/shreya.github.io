**Challenges and Market Benefits**

Depending on the Netflix subscription plan, multiple users can stream content simultaneously on different devices. Each user can log in and watch independently without affecting the streaming experience of others on the same account.Users can maintain their privacy by having separate viewing histories and watchlists. This also optimizes the personalized content discovery process without interference from others using the same account.
