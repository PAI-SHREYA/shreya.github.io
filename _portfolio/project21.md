**Challenges and Market Benefits**

The challenge in content compression and decompression is handling the large volume of multimedia data. This includes ensuring that compression does not significantly degrade quality and that decompression is fast enough to support real-time streaming. Another challenge is the need to balance compression ratios with computational complexity, as more sophisticated algorithms can be more resource-intensive.
Effective compression and decompression can significantly reduce storage costs and improve streaming performance. By efficiently compressing content, Netflix can store more movies and shows within the same storage capacity, leading to cost savings. Additionally, efficient decompression ensures that users experience minimal buffering and high-quality playback, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.

**Design Technique**

**_1.Huffman Coding_**

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes for more frequent characters.
Huffman coding can be used:

1.To compress metadata like subtitles, descriptions, and titles using Huffman coding to save storage space.

2.To apply it to the difference between consecutive video frames to achieve further compression.

It uses a binary heap to ensure efficient extraction of the minimum frequency nodes.In video compression, Huffman coding can be used in conjunction with other entropy coding methods (like Arithmetic coding or Golomb coding).Huffman coding assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring symbols (e.g., pixel values or motion vectors), optimizing the overall bitstream size.

**_2.Discrete Cosine Transform_**

DCT converts spatial domain data (like video frames) into frequency domain data, which can then be quantized and compressed.

**_3.Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Algorithm_**

LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated sequences with references to a dictionary.This can be used in script and dialogue Compression.
Design:

Compress subtitle text by replacing repeated phrases and sentences with dictionary references.

Use LZW to compress scripts and dialogues that often have repeated lines or phrases.

**Complexity Analyssis and Code**

-**_Huffman Coding_**

Construction: O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters.

Encoding/Decoding: O(n), where n is the length of the input data.
