title: Search Optimization
subtitle: Users expect quick and accurate search results from applications and websites. Efficient search functionality is crucial for improving user experience, increasing engagement, and ensuring users find relevant content promptly. Optimizing search queries, processing large datasets efficiently, and handling dynamic data are key challenges in search optimization.

**Design Technique**

_**1.Square Root Decomposition:**_
For optimizing search queries, particularly for range queries.Square Root Decomposition divides the data into smaller blocks to handle range queries more efficiently. This approach is beneficial when dealing with large datasets where direct query processing would be too slow.

_Scenario: User Engagement Scores for Netflix Titles_

We have a user engagement scores for various Netflix titles. These scores could be based on metrics such as views, likes, comments, or a combination thereof. We want to efficiently query and analyze which titles have the highest engagement scores using Square Root Decomposition.
Title                   | User Engagement Score
------------------------|-----------------------
Stranger Things         | 92
The Crown               | 85
Money Heist             | 89
Bridgerton              | 94
Ozark                   | 88
The Witcher             | 87
Narcos                  | 84
House of Cards          | 91
Black Mirror            | 90
The Umbrella Academy    | 86

Divide the list of titles into blocks. The number of blocks ùëò= sqrt(n).
n is the total number of titles.

Netflix Titles:

Block 1: [Stranger Things, The Crown, Money Heist]

Block 2: [Bridgerton, Ozark, The Witcher]

Block 3: [Narcos, House of Cards, Black Mirror, The Umbrella Academy]

Square Root Decomposition is applied here to efficiently query and analyze user engagement scores for Netflix titles. By dividing the dataset into blocks and processing queries within these blocks, we can quickly identify titles with the highest engagement scores, providing insights into popular content on the platform.

_**2.MO's Algorithm:**_
MO's Algorithm sorts and processes multiple range queries on a dataset, optimizing the query handling process.

_**3.Binary Search:**_
Binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

_**4. Trie Data Structure:**_
